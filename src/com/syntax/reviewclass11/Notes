Non-Access modifiers.
We have four types of non-access modifiers in java
static final abstract synchronized.
There is no relationship between these modifiers and they are optional a nd represent
separate concepts in java.
static
is keyword in java that help use define entities at class level like variables and methods
we can also use to define classes using static keyword.
final:
is keyword in java that help us tell java that the entities are complete like variables methods and classes.
If it is used with class then it prevents inheritance by not allowing you to create subclasses.
If it is used with methods then it prevents overriding, you cannot override a final method in Java.
If it is used with variables then they are treated as constant because you cannot change their value once assigned.
abstract:
Keyword is used to define something that is incomplete. we use this abstract key word with methods to give only the definition
and use this with classes to make them abstract and not be able to create the objects of these classes.
because they are incomplete.
If we have any method of a class as abstract we need to declare the class as abstract. but we can have a class an abstract without any methods
synchronized
this keyword is used in multithreading to avoid race condition.
